## Title

<!-- A clear and concise title for the PR, e.g., "Add new logging functionality" for a feature or "Fix memory leak in data processing module" for an issue -->

## Description

<!-- A summary of the changes made and their impact, e.g., "This PR introduces a new logging framework to enhance system observability." -->

### For Feature PRs

_Please remove this section if your PR is for an issue._

- **Problem Statement**:
    <!-- Clearly state the problem or need the feature addresses, e.g., "Currently, there is no efficient way to track system errors in real-time." -->
- **Requirements**:
    <!-- List the specific requirements and objectives of the feature, e.g., "Implement real-time error tracking with a minimal performance overhead." -->
- **Design & Architecture**:
    <!-- Attach or link to the design and architecture documents, e.g., "See attached design.pdf" -->
- **Implementation Overview**:
    <!-- Briefly describe the implementation approach and key components used, e.g., "The feature utilizes the XYZ logging library to capture and store logs." -->
- **Test Cases**:
    <!-- Detail test cases considered and covered, including edge cases, e.g., "Test cases include system startup, failure scenarios, and high-load conditions." -->
- **Dependencies**:
    <!-- List any new dependencies or changes to existing ones, e.g., "Added XYZ logging library v2.3.1 as a dependency." -->
- **Performance Considerations**:
    <!-- Discuss any performance impacts or improvements, e.g., "Initial tests show a 2% increase in response time under normal load." -->
- **Security Implications**:
    <!-- Address any security concerns raised by the new feature, e.g., "Logs are sanitized to prevent sensitive data exposure." -->
- **Documentation Updates**:
    <!-- Highlight changes or additions required in documentation, e.g., "Updated the system maintenance guide to include log monitoring instructions." -->
- **User Impact**:
    <!-- Describe how the feature will affect end-users, if applicable, e.g., "Users will experience slightly longer loading times during system startup." -->
- **Demo or Screenshots**:
    <!-- Include links to demos or screenshots for visual understanding, e.g., "See attached demo.mp4 for feature demonstration." -->
- **Impacts**:
    <!-- Describe the impact on existing systems and functionalities, e.g., "The feature requires updates to existing error handling modules." -->
- **Risks**:
    <!-- Identify potential risks and their mitigation strategies, e.g., "Risk of increased system load, mitigated by load balancing." -->
- **What's Next**:
    <!-- Outline next steps or further development needed, e.g., "Next, we plan to implement real-time alerting based on error logs." -->

### For Issue PRs

- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:
    <!-- Provide a detailed RCA, e.g., "The memory leak was caused by an unclosed database connection in the data processing module." -->
- **Incident Overview**:
    <!-- Provide a brief overview of the incident leading to the hotfix, e.g., "A significant memory leak was detected, leading to system instability." -->
- **Affected Systems**:
    <!-- List the systems or components affected by the issue, e.g., "The issue impacts the data processing and storage modules." -->
- **User Impact Analysis**:
    <!-- Detail how users were impacted and to what extent, e.g., "Users experienced slow system responses and occasional downtime." -->
- **Resolution Timeline**:
    <!-- Outline the timeline of how the issue was resolved, e.g., "The issue was identified and fixed within 12 hours of the first report." -->
- **Preventive Measures**:
    <!-- Propose measures to prevent similar issues in the future, e.g., "We will implement automated checks for unclosed database connections." -->
- **Urgency Justification**:
    <!-- Explain why the hotfix is urgent or critical, e.g., "Immediate resolution was required due to the impact on system stability." -->
- **Monitoring Plan**:
    <!-- Describe plans for monitoring post-deployment, e.g., "We will monitor system performance closely for the next 48 hours to ensure stability." -->
- **Postmortem**:
    <!-- Attach or link to a postmortem report, if available, e.g., "See attached postmortem_report.pdf for a detailed analysis." -->
